# Jump 2D System


Hi this project consists of my jump 2D system in unity 2D.
In the only scene there is a player. The player moves with the a / d buttons and jumps with w. 
The scripts you need to adjust the jump (in their inspectors) are "PlayerManager" (in the gameObject "Player") and "ForceManagerSystem" (in the GameObject "LevelManager").

Enjoy.

P.S: the project uses the Unity 2018.3 version.

There is a build: 
-"a"/"s" for movement
- "w" for jump
